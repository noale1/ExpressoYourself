# Contact Us ☕️

Welcome to **Expresso Yourself**—where coffee meets chaos, and four college students somehow built an entire online shop (between exams and existential crises). Need help? Want to chat about coffee? Or just wonder how we manage to function on 3 hours of sleep? Reach out—we’re not going anywhere... unless there's free coffee.

## Who Are We?

We’re **Yoav, Noa, Itay, and Daniel**—four fearless (and highly caffeinated) students from the **College of Management**. We started this coffee shop between cram sessions and questionable life choices. What started as a need for more caffeine turned into a mission to spread the love of coffee—and puns—across the internet.

(PS: If you see any missing assignments, tell our professors we’ve been “researching the global coffee market.”)
